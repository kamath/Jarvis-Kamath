# Jarvis Kamath

It's just a really basic version of Zuckerburg's Jarvis. It's pretty sweet if you ask me. It can control your computer via Facebook messenger, involving playing music and saying stuff.

## Demo:
[See demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGitU0iMVVk)

## Installation
Basically I took shpotify and the facebook-chat-api npm package and turned Facebook Messenger into an ssh client. All you need to do is 

1. clone the repo <br>git clone http://github.com/andykamath/Jarvis-Kamath && cd Jarvis-Kamath</code>
2. change your email and password in the index.js file
3. Install [Shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) in the root directory <br><code>git clone https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify && mv spotify ../</code>
3. run <code>~$ cd fb-chat-ssh && npm install && node index.js</code>

and you should be golden

## Things it can do
* Display commands - "show commands"
* Control your music - "music [play|pause|next|prev|vol up/down]"
* Set passwords - "pw [site, i.e. facebook] [password, i.e. hunter21]"
* Get passwords - "pw get [site]"
* Run any Mac terminal command like ls, say, echo, touch, cat, etc.

I used [shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/archive/master.zip) and [facebook-chat-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/facebook-chat-api)

# IMPORTANT: This has only been tested on Mac. Music controls only work on Mac. Everything else *may* work on Linux/Windows, but no guarantee
